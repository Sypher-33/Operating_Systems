Siri is a fun user interface option available for MacOS. I strongly believe it's the closest mainstream AI assistant concept with voice activated controls.
Siri actually utilizes other applications on your OS and even goes online to bring up relevant information through a web search utilizing whatever default search
engine you have set.

Another feature about Mac is the trackpad user-interface, which is arguably superior to any PC variation. The trackpad for MacOS allows for scrolling, moving, right-clicking, dragging, zooming, back and forward page loading, windows overview, side bar views and creating a new screen. It is extremely versatile taking into account multiple finger use with one hand given its simplistic design.

The stabiliy of the Mac OS is exceptional to say the least, I have only ever had two Apple computers in my life and I had them for years before I physically broke them by accident. Technically my mac still works, making this product an extremely dependable one. Never have I even seen an Apple computer crash due to system failure, I have however seen numerous PC's crash due to corrupt or damaged code, or even simple malware.
